eShapeoko Parts and MakerSlide Accessories
=====

These are the master drawings for custom parts for the eShapeoko CNC milling machine
and for various other projects based on MakerSlide (for example, the camera slider).

Most of them are generally useful MakerSlide accessories, but some parts are designed
specifically for the eShapeoko.

For now, MegaRail 80 and MegaRail Z also live here.

The eShapeoko is based on Edward Ford's open-source CNC milling machine, the Shapeoko.
Thank you, Edward!

Both Shapeoko and eShapeoko rely on Bart Dring's open-source linear motion system,
MakerSlide. Thank you, Bart!
